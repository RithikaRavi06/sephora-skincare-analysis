# Sephora Skincare Review Analysis 

This project analyzes Sephora skincare reviews using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover customer preferences, common concerns, and product satisfaction trends. I explored how factors like ingredients, star ratings, and review sentiment shape customer behavior â€” insights that could guide merchandising, product growth, and seller success on e-commerce platforms.

**Skills Used:** Python, data wrangling, visualization, exploratory insights

**Goal:** Understand what drives positive reviews in the skincare category and how that data can inform product development and platform strategy.
